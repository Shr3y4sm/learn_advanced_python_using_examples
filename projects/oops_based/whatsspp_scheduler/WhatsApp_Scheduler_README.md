# WhatsApp Message Scheduler

This project contains a simple WhatsApp message scheduler implemented in an object-oriented way.

## Directory Structure


## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages using pip:
   ```sh
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Open the main.py file and modify the phone_numbers list and common_message as needed.
Run the main.py script:

```
python main.py

Note
Ensure that you have WhatsApp Web logged in and the browser is open.

```vbnet

This structure separates the class definition from the main script, making the code more modular and easier to maintain. The `README.md` file provides instructions on how to set up and use the program.
